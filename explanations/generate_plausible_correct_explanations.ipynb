    "start_phrase=\"QUESTION: Does histologic chorioamnionitis correspond to clinical chorioamnionitis?\\nCONTEXT: To evaluate the degree to which histologic chorioamnionitis, a frequent finding in placentas submitted for histopathologic evaluation, correlates with clinical indicators of infection in the mother. A retrospective review was performed on 52 cases with a histologic diagnosis of acute chorioamnionitis from 2,051 deliveries at University Hospital, Newark, from January 2003 to July 2003. Third-trimester placentas without histologic chorioamnionitis (n = 52) served as controls. Cases and controls were selected sequentially. Maternal medical records were reviewed for indicators of maternal infection. Histologic chorioamnionitis was significantly associated with the usage of antibiotics (p = 0.0095) and a higher mean white blood cell count (p = 0.018). The presence of 1 or more clinical indicators was significantly associated with the presence of histologic chorioamnionitis (p = 0.019).\\nSHORT ANSWER (Correct and plausible): Yes.\\nLONG ANSWER (Correct and plausible): The presence of histologic chorioamnionitis appears to be significantly associated with clinical indicators of infection in the mother, such as the usage of antibiotics and a higher mean white blood cell count. This suggests a correlation between histologic chorioamnionitis and clinical chorioamnionitis. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the absence of histologic chorioamnionitis does not necessarily rule out the presence of clinical chorioamnionitis, and vice versa. Clinical manifestations of chorioamnionitis can vary, and histologic examination may not always capture the full spectrum of the condition. Therefore, while histologic chorioamnionitis may serve as an important indicator of maternal infection, it should be interpreted alongside clinical findings to provide a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition.\"\n",
